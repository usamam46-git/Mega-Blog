# 📰 Pro Blog

Mega Blog is a full-featured blogging platform built with **React**, powered by **Appwrite** for backend and authentication, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and enhanced with the **TinyMCE Editor** for rich text editing.

This was my first complete blog project where I focused heavily on **functionality**, **clean architecture**, and **production-level practices**.  
It’s a personal milestone in my learning journey toward building scalable full-stack web apps.
